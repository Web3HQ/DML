QML as a data store:

1users
	1.1alice
		1.1.1fulln=Alice Althea
		1.1.1addr>=dataddress
	1.2bob
		1.2.1fulln=Bob Bulbasaur
		1.2.1addr>=dataddress

Compared to JSON:

{
"users":[{
"alice":[{
"fulln":"Alice Althea",
"addr":"dataddress",
}],
"bob":[{
"fulln":"Bob Bulbasaur",
"addr":"dataddress",
}]
}]
}

QML haves 5 lines & 8-17 characters less than JSON.

QML can also be smaller for bigger datasets:

1alice
	1.1fulln=Alice Althea
	1.1addr>=dataddress
1bob
	1.1fulln=Bob Bulbasaur
	1.1addr>=dataddress

Usually QML haves 5 lines & 8-17 characters less than JSON.
